    <summary>
      Represents a MySql transaction to be made in a MyMySql database. This class cannot be inherited.
    </summary>

    <remarks>
      The application creates a <B>MyMySqlTransaction</B> object by calling <see cref="MyMySqlConnection.BeginTransaction()"/>
      on the <see cref="MyMySqlConnection"/> object. All subsequent operations associated with the
      transaction (for example, committing or aborting the transaction), are performed on the
      <B>MyMySqlTransaction</B> object.
    </remarks>

    <example>
      The following example creates a <see cref="MyMySqlConnection"/> and a <B>MyMySqlTransaction</B>.
      It also demonstrates how to use the <see cref="MyMySqlConnection.BeginTransaction()"/>,
      <see cref="MyMySqlTransaction.Commit"/>, and <see cref="MyMySqlTransaction.Rollback"/> methods.

  <Rollback>
    <summary>
      Rolls back a transaction from a pending state.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The Rollback method is equivalent to the MyMySql statement ROLLBACK.
      The transaction can only be rolled back from a pending state
      (after BeginTransaction has been called, but before Commit is
      called).
